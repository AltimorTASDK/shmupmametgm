This is a modified version of MAME with modifications in Psikyo SH-2 emulation (tgm2, tgm2p) that eliminate one extra frame of lag compared to vanilla MAME.
#+END_QUOTE

This version correctly configures MAME to use 4-way stick emulation for tgm2p and also backports a framerate fix so tgm2p should run at the correct ~61.681 fps.
